WeRateDogs® is a popular Twitter handle with more than 9.2 million followers that 
posts and rates images of incredible dogs. They are a non-profit organization that 
provides expert dog ratings. Dog owners and aficionados around the world share 
images of their pets, which are then rated by other dog owners.

The dataset contains several attributes which include the tweet_id, timestamp,

Most of the dog ratings had a denominator of 10 meanwhile the numerator ranges 
from 0 to 1776. This unique rating system is a big part of the popularity of 
WeRateDogs.
